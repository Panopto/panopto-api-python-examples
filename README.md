# Panopto REST API Examples with Python 3

This repository includes examples that demonstrate how Panopto's REST API can be used with Python 3.

- [auth-server-side-web-app](auth-server-side-web-app): Authorization as Server-side Web Application
- [auth-user-based-app](auth-user-based-app): Authorization as User Based Server Application
- [auth-id-provider](auth-id-provider): Authorization for ID provider integration
- [common](common): Shared code used by multiple examples
- [folders-cli](folders-cli): Command line application with Folders API
- [scheduled-recording-crud](scheduled-recording-crud): Create/read/update/delete via Scheduled Recording API.
- [sessions-cli](sessions-cli): Command line application with Sessions API

## Warning
Those samples do not necessarily implement complete error handling or retry logic. As the best practice, you should have both proper error handling and reasonable retry logic in production code.

## Capture traffic
It is useful to capture the actual network traffic with a capture tool, like [Fiddler on Windows](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or [Charles on Mac](https://www.charlesproxy.com/), and examine it.
The samples in repository generally accept ```--skip-verify``` option for that purpose, so that they ignore the SSL certificate replaced by such tool and continue to run.

### An issue with urllib3
This method does not work with the latest Python urllib3 library as of 2022-07-09, version `1.26.10`. 
As a workaround, you may install the older version of urllib3 by the following commandline.
```
pip install --upgrade urllib3==1.25.11
```
