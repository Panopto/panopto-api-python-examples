# Command line application with Sessions API
This sample demonstrates the usage of the Sessions API.

## Preparation
1. You need a Panopto user account. If you don't have it, ask your organization's Panopto administrator.
2. If you do not have Python 3 on your system, install the latest stable version from https://python.org
3. Install external modules for this application.
```
pip install requests oauthlib requests_oauthlib
```
4. Follow [this workaround](../README.md#An-issue-with-urllib3) as needed.

## Setup API Client on Panopto server
See the instruction for [Authorization as Server-side Web Application](../auth-server-side-web-app/README.md)

## Run the sample
Type the following command.
```
python sample.py --server [Panopto server name] --client-id [Client ID] --client-secret [Client Secret] --session-id [Session ID]
```
This starts command line interaction of session management. The `session-id` parameter is optional. If provided, then the sample will
load that session automatically when it begins. Otherwise, you can search for a session after the sample program loads.
